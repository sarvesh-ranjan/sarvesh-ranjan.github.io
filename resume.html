					<p class="pull-right">Aug 2014 ~ Jul 2015</p>
					<p><strong>Cisco Systems, San Jose CA, </strong>Cisco International Internship Program</p>
					<ul class="text-justify">
						<li>Worked with OpenStack team under Office of Cloud, CVG for one year in San Jose. Worked on
							projects in the fields of OpenStack, Machine Learning, NLP and contributed to upstream code of
							open source projects like Apache Kafka & Storm. Currently an active contributor in Ceilometer and
							Cinder projects in OpenStack. Worked on following projects:<li>
							• Multi dimensional anomaly detection and disk failure prediction.<li>
							• Read and write optimization in Ceph object storage system.<li>
							• PlaceWise: A smart (multi-) cloud resource placement recommendation engine and service.<li>
							• Cognitive: Machine learning as a service.<li>
							• Authentication and security in Apache Kafka pub-sub system.<li>
							• Multi node OpenStack cluster deployment and management.<li>
							• Designing Elasticsearch, Kibana and Logstash based logs & metrics pipeline and performing policy
							based cloud monitoring.<li>
							Integral part of the team which created Software as a service Cisco product called Cisco Zeus.<li>
							Participated in OpenStack summit in Vancouver as a speaker and presented work about Demystifying Logs in OpenStack Clouds.</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="pull-right">Aug 2015 ~ Present</p>
					<p><strong>Cisco Systems, San Jose CA, </strong>Engineering Consultant</p>
					<ul class="text-justify">
						<li>Working remotely with OpenStack team in Cisco, San Jose. Current project focusses on creating
							advanced data science and monitoring services on top of Cisco Zeus. This project involves devising
							methods for system health checks, monitoring, creating policy based alarms, and data backup
							systems for failure prevention. This project also involves creating load balanced data storage
							mechanism for multiple site data center scenarios and aims to perform locality based data replication
							using erasure codes.</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="pull-right">May 2014 ~ Jul 2014</p>
					<p><strong>Wipro Limited, Bangalore </strong>Reliable Flash Storage System with Erasure Codes</p>
					<ul class="text-justify">
						<li>This project's aim was to create Erasure codes and improve the performance of data replication and
							storage methods used by Microsoft Azure. Used Reed-Solomon codes & erasures and decreased
							the amount of replication needed to create a multi level, multi-tier block object storage system which
							is highly scalable and reliable without increasing the cost of storing extra data.</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="pull-right">May 2013 ~ Jul 2013</p>
					<p><strong>Impetus Infotech Pvt. Ltd., </strong>Design and Implementation of MapReduce Workflow Optimizer</p>
					<ul class="text-justify">
						<li>This project's aim was to devise an algorithm for scheduling hadoop jobs in MapReduce frameworks.
							The algorithm focused on rescheduling hadoop jobs using code realignment and created DAGs to
							rescheduled the SQL like queries. This algorithm was then implemented in the profiler of
							Jumbune(TM), product of Impetus Technologies, Inc. This was later used to create task executor.</li>

					<h3 class="content-title">Projects</h3>
					<p><strong>Multi Dimensional Anomaly Detection and Applications in Image Processing</strong></p>
					<ul class="text-justify">
						<li>Working on creating novel methods for anomaly detection in multi dimensional space. I'm trying to
							create a system where a user can define thresholds and set anomaly parameters which can be used
							to find anomalous metric(s) and detect the root cause of the anomaly which is useful for failure
							prediction and failure avoidance. This can be used for root cause analysis by correlating metrics with
							logs and Image similarity detection.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Cisco Internal Webex Social Recommendation System (Webex++)</strong></p>
					<ul class="text-justify">
						<li>WebEx++ is a continually improving knowledge base of posts, questions and answers created, edited and organized by everyone who uses it. Equipped with the advanced techniques of Machine Learning and NLP, it is a platform that will enable our employees to share their knowledge, questions, ideas and expertise.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h3 class="content-title">Projects</h3>
					<p><strong>Demystifying logs in OpenStack clouds</strong></p>
					<ul class="text-justify">
						<li>OpenStack services create a big jungle of logs and metrics and provide cloud operators tremendous
							insights. As part of this project Cisco proprietary systems were created that answers questions about
							most interesting and actionable logs out of TBs of logs, finds correlated logs and metrics, finds
							cascading & propagating logs, does root causes of issues, gives early warning signals for potential
							operational issues, lists typical parameters associated with common event pairs like average time
							between occurrence, association rules, preceding and successive events. A Django driven
							application was created to find the logs which were indicators of faults & create sleek visualizations
							for ease of cluster management.</li>
					</ul>

					<p><strong>Brand-specific Social Score: Identifying Brand supporters & detractors through Social Media</strong></p>
					<ul class="text-justify">
						<li>The project involved collecting and analyzing social media data using techniques of data mining and
							machine learning to provide actionable intelligence to marketeers. A web application was developed
							to demonstrate the process and visualize the results.</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Web Server Selection</strong></p>
					<ul class="text-justify">
						<li>A database driven application was built that stores information about the eating joints (canteens,
							cafeterias, restaurants etc) in and around the college campus.</li>
						</ul>
					<p><strong>Database driven application about the eating joints</strong></p>
					<ul class="text-justify">
						<li>The project involved collecting and analyzing social media data using techniques of data mining and
							machine learning to provide actionable intelligence to marketeers. A web application was developed
							to demonstrate the process and visualize the results.</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Implementation of an assembler for a SIC/XE machine</strong></p>
					<ul class="text-justify">
						<li>This was the design of a basic Assembler coded in C++. The program was designed to read a file
							containing SIC or SIC/XE programs. It was designed to compile the code and generate the Symbol
							Table, Machine Code, Object Code, Argument Table and Definition Table.</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Building alarming and evacuation system using sensors</strong></p>
					<ul class="text-justify">
						<li>This project focussed on devising a novel algorithm for emergency evacuation system using Cisco
							CMX sensors and mobile devices to find safest unobstructed path for evacuation.</li>
